This project is unfinished but shows how a self-hosting lisp for javascript might work. It runs in the browser and using node.

I'm reworking the code under github.com/tristanstraub/cl-teapot. I released it now because there are better options such as ClojureScript, which are much nicer in most respects (but not self-hosting).

You'll need to install node to be able to bootstrap the compiler, but it's already there under static/js/teapot.js. You can compile lisp files with:

$ node static/js/teapot.js --compile browser.lisp  > static/js/browser.lisp

To test it in the browser, run ./serve.sh and navigation to http://localhost:8000/.
You can test it at http://tristanstraub.com/projects/teapot

Click on "drawsquare" to load "lisp/drawsquare.lisp".

From the REPL,

$ (load "drawsquare")

will load the same file.
